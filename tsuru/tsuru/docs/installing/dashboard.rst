Dashboard
+++++++++

One of the ways to interact with your tsuru installation is using the
`tsuru dashboard <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru-dashboard>`_.
The dashboard provides interesting features for both tsuru users (application information,
metrics and logs for example) and tsuru admins (hosts metrics, healings and much more).

The dashboard runs as a regular tsuru Python application. This guide will cover:

    1. Adding the Python platform
    2. Creating the dashboard app
    3. Deploying the tsuru dashboard

You should already have a pool and at least one docker node to run your applications.
Please refer to :doc:`adding nodes </installing/adding-nodes>` for more details.

--------------------------
Adding the Python platform
--------------------------

Platforms are responsible for building and running your application. The dashboard requires
the Python platform, which can be easily installed with:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    tsuru platform-add python

This will install the default Python platform. Please refer to :doc:`add platform </managing/add-platform>`
for more details.

--------------------------
Creating the dashboard app
--------------------------

Now, lets create the dashboard application:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    tsuru app-create tsuru-dashboard python -t admin

This will create an application called tsuru-dashboard which uses the Python platform
and belongs to the admin team. Please refer to the
`app-create client reference <https://tsuru-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#create-an-application>`_
for more information.


-----------------------
Deploying the dashboard
-----------------------

There are several ways to deploy an application in tsuru: git push, app-deploy and
app-deploy using docker images. The easiest way to deploy the dashboard is by using
app-deploy with its docker image. To do that, simply type:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    tsuru app-deploy -a tsuru-dashboard -i tsuru/dashboard

This will deploy the docker image `tsuru/dashboard <https://hub.docker.com/r/tsuru/dashboard/>`_
to the app we just created. Please refer to the
`app-deploy client reference <https://tsuru-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#deploy>`_
for more information.

Once the deploy finishes, we can run:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    tsuru app-info -a tsuru-dashboard


to check it's address and access it on our browser.
