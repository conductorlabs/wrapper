tsr 0.10.1 release notes
========================

Welcome to tsr 0.10.1!

tsr 0.10.1 includes two improvements from the previous version and one bug fix:

* During start-up and image migration, skip applications that have already been
  moved (related to issue `#712 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/712>`_);
* Limit healing for Docker nodes. Now tsuru will heal Docker nodes when only
  there's a network error in the communication between the tsuru API and the
  Docker node with general operations, like pulling an image. When creating a
  container, any failure will count as a trigger for healing;
* Fix bug with authorization in the deploy hook, that allowed users to issue
  deployments to any application, via the API.
