tsr 0.10.2 release notes
========================

Welcome to tsr 0.10.2!

tsr 0.10.2 includes one bug fixes to administration commands:

*  tsuru-admin commands ``container-move``, ``containers-move`` and ``containers-
   rebalance`` caused tsuru server to freeze. This issue was caused by a global
   mutex for all connections being permanently locked. This fix eliminates the
   global mutex and instead creates an independent lock per request. A performance
   improvement in api calls is also expected with this fix.
