tsr 0.11.2 release notes
========================

Welcome to tsr 0.11.2!

tsr 0.11.2 includes some bug fixes and adds performance improvements related to
the database management:

* Fix of database connection leaks across the entire code base, including a
  mechanism for automatically detecting new connection leaks. Also preventing
  new connection leaks by always closing the connection on object's finalizer.

* Fix compatibility with Docker 1.6+. Docker 1.6 introduced a new way of
  limiting container resources (CPU and memory). See `issue #1213
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1213>`_ for more details.

* Introduced a new configuration entry, for splitting the main database and the
  logs database, avoiding issues with global locks in MongoDB. For more
  details, see the :ref:`configuration docs <config_logdb>`.

* Performance improvements in the log processing: properly ordering the logs
  and using less indexes to speed up write operations.

* Add a hard timeout to healthcheck requests, preventing stale of deployments
  while tsuru waits for the response of the application healthcheck. The
  current value for this timeout is 1 minute.
