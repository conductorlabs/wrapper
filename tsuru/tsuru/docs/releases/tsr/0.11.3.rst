tsr 0.11.3 release notes
========================

Welcome to tsr 0.11.3!

tsr 0.11.3 includes fixes related to the deploy process:

* New configuration options related to timeouts in pub/sub redis connections.
  Default timeout values set so we can fail fast and not hang if there are
  connection problems accessing the redis server. See :ref:`config
  reference<config_pubsub>` for more details.

* Writing deploy execution logs is done in background to prevent slow storage
  backends from interfering in deploy time.

* Hitting Ctrl-C during a deploy does not stop the deploy process anymore. It
  can be followed again using ``app-log``. `#1238
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1238>`_
