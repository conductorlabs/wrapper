==============================

All existing apps have no team owner.
You can run the mongodb script below to automatically set the first existing team in the app as team owner.

.. highlight:: javascript

::

    db.apps.find({ teamowner: { $exists: false }}).forEach(
        function(app) {
            app.teamowner = app.teams[0];
            db.apps.save(app);
        }
    );
