tsr 0.5.1 release notes
=======================

Welcome to tsr 0.5.1!

These release notes cover the :ref:`new features <new-0.5.1>`,
:ref:`bug fixes <bug-0.5.1>` and
:ref:`backwards incompatible changes <backwards-0.5.1>` you'll want to be aware
of when upgrading from tsr 0.5.0 or older versions.

.. _new-0.5.1:

What's new in tsr 0.5.1
=======================

* **tsr api** now checks tsuru.conf file and refuse to start if it is
  misconfigured. It's also possible to exclusively test the config file with
  the -t flag.  i.e.: running "tsr api -t". (`#714
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/714>`_).
* new command in the ``tsuru-admin``: the command fix-containers will look for
  broken containers and fix their configuration within the router, and in the
  database

.. _bug-0.5.1:

Bug fixes
=========

* Do not lock application on ``tsuru run``

.. _backwards-0.5.1:

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

* **tsr collector** is no more. In the 0.5.0 release, collector got much less
  responsibilities, and now it does nothing, because it no longer exists. The
  last of its responsibilities is now available in the ``tsuru-admin
  fix-containers`` command.
