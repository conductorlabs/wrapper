tsr 0.5.2 release notes
=======================

Welcome to tsr 0.5.2!

These release notes cover the :ref:`new features <new-0.5.2>` and
:ref:`bug fixes <bug-0.5.2>` you'll want to be aware of when upgrading from
tsr 0.5.1 or older versions.

.. _new-0.5.2:

What's new in tsr 0.5.2
=======================

Improvements
============

* improve the Docker cluster management so it keeps track of which node
  contains a certain image, so a request to remove an image from the cluster
  can be sent only to the proper nodes (`docker-cluster #22
  <https://github.com/tsuru/docker-cluster/issues/22>`_).
* improve error handling on OAuth authentication

.. _bug-0.5.2:

Bug fixes
=========

* Check if node exists before excludind it (mongo doesn't return an error if I
  try to remove a node which not exists from a pool) (`#840
  <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/840>`_).
* Fix race condition in unit-remove that prevented the command from removing
  the requested number of units
* Fix app lock management in unit-remove
