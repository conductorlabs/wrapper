tsr 0.8.1 release notes
=======================

Welcome to tsr 0.8.1!

These release notes cover the 0.8.1 bug fixes.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fix trying to heal containers multiple times when it's unresponsive. Now tsuru
  will try to acquire a lock before storing the healing event. The healing will
  only be started if the lock has been successfully acquired and the container
  still exists in the database after the lock has been checked.
* Containers without exported ports (used during deploy) and with stopped state
  (set by running ``tsuru stop`` on the application) won't be healed anymore.
* The api call /services/proxy/{instance} route now will correctly handle HTTP
  headers. Previously, request headers weren't send from tsuru to the service,
  neither were response headers set by the service sent back to the client.
