tsurud 0.12.2 release notes
===========================

Welcome to tsurud 0.12.2!

tsurud 0.12.2 includes bug fixes related to application environment
variables.

Bug fixes
=========

Two different bugs prevented commands setting and unsetting environment
variables for an application from working correctly. This release also depends
on updating platforms to use tsuru-unit-agent version 0.4.5.

* The first bug prevented ``env-unset`` from working because environment
  variables were being committed in the application image during the deploy.
  This way, it wasn't possible to unset a variable because even if they were not
  used when starting a new container the image would include them.

* The second bug prevented ``env-set`` from overriding the value of a previously
  set environment variable after at least one deploy happened with the first
  value set.

  This bug happened because during deploy tsuru would write a file called
  ``apprc`` including all environment variables available during the deploy and
  this file would then be loaded in the application environment, overriding
  environment variables used to start the container.

  This file was only needed by tsuru versions before 0.12.0 and the solution was
  simply not to add application environment variables to this file anymore if
  tsuru server is greater than or equal to 0.12.0.
