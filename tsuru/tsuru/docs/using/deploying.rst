Deploying
=========

Application requirements
------------------------

To your application supports horizontal scale it's recommended that the
application follow the `12 Factor <http://www.12factor.net/>`_ principles.

For example, if your application uses local memory to store session data it
should not works as expected with more than one `unit`.

Select a deployment process
---------------------------

tsuru supports three ways of deployment (git, app-deploy, Docker image):

Git
+++

Git deployments are based on tsuru `platforms` and are useful if you want to
track the difference between the deployments.

app-deploy
++++++++++

The `app-deploy` deployments are based on tsuru `platforms` and are useful for
automated deployments.

:doc:`Learn how to deploy applications using app-deploy </using/app-deploy>`.

Docker image
++++++++++++

Docker image deployments allows you to take a Docker image from a registry
ensuring that you are running the same image in development and in production.
