Building your app in tsuru
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

tsuru is an open source polyglot cloud application platform. With tsuru, you
don't need to think about servers at all. You:

- Write apps in the programming language of your choice
- Back it with add-on resources (tsuru calls these *services*) such as SQL and
  NoSQL databases, memcached, redis, and many others.
- Manage your app using the ``tsuru`` command-line tool
- Deploy code using the Git revision control system

tsuru takes care of where in your cluster to run your apps and the services
they use. You can then focus on making your apps awesome.
