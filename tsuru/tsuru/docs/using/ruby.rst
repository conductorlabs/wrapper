Deploying Ruby applications

Overview
========

This document is a hands-on guide to deploying a simple Ruby application in
tsuru. The example application will be a very simple Rails project associated
to a MySQL service.

Creating the app
================

To create an app, you use the command `app-create`:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app-create <app-name> <app-platform>

For Ruby, the app platform is ``ruby``! Let's be over creative and develop a
never-developed tutorial-app: a blog, and its name will also be very creative,
let's call it "blog":

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app-create blog ruby

To list all available platforms, use the command `platform-list`.

You can see all your applications using the command `app-list`:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app-list
    +-------------+-------------------------+-------------+
    | Application | Units State Summary     | Address     |
    +-------------+-------------------------+-------------+
    | blog        | 0 of 0 units in-service |             |
    +-------------+-------------------------+-------------+

Application code
================

This document will not focus on how to write a blog with Rails, you can clone
the entire source direct from GitHub:
https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru-ruby-sample. Here is what we did for the
project:

#. Create the project (``rails new blog``)
#. Generate the scaffold for Post (``rails generate scaffold Post title:string body:text``)

Git deployment
==============

When you create a new app, tsuru will display the Git remote that you should
use. You can always get it using the command `app-info`:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app-info --app blog
    Application: blog
    Repository: git@192.168.50.4.nip.io:blog.git
    Platform: ruby
    Teams: admin
    Address: blog.192.168.50.4.nip.io
    Owner: admin@example.com
    Team owner: admin
    Deploys: 0
    Pool: theonepool

    App Plan:
    +---------------+--------+------+-----------+---------+
    | Name          | Memory | Swap | Cpu Share | Default |
    +---------------+--------+------+-----------+---------+
    | autogenerated | 0 MB   | 0 MB | 100       | false   |
    +---------------+--------+------+-----------+---------+

The Git remote will be used to deploy your application using Git. You can just
push to tsuru remote and your project will be deployed:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ git push git@192.168.50.4.nip.io:blog.git master
    Counting objects: 86, done.
    Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (75/75), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (86/86), 29.75 KiB, done.
    Total 86 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)

    remote:  ---> App will be restarted, please check its log for more details...
    remote:
    To git@192.168.50.4.nip.io:blog.git
     * [new branch]      master -> master

If you get a "Permission denied (publickey).", make sure you're member of a
team and have a public key added to tsuru. To add a key, use the command `key-add`:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru key-add mykey ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

You can use ``git remote add`` to avoid typing the entire remote url every time
you want to push:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ git remote add tsuru git@192.168.50.4.nip.io:blog.git

Then you can run:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ git push tsuru master
    Everything up-to-date

And you will be also able to omit the ``--app`` flag from now on:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tsuru app-info
    Application: blog
    Repository: git@192.168.50.4.nip.io:blog.git
    Platform: ruby
    Teams: admin
    Address: blog.192.168.50.4.nip.io
    Owner: admin@example.com
    Team owner: admin
    Deploys: 0

    | Name          | Memory | Swap | Cpu Share | Default |
    +---------------+--------+------+-----------+---------+
    | autogenerated | 0 MB   | 0 MB | 100       | false   |
    +---------------+--------+------+-----------+---------+

Listing dependencies
====================

In the last section we omitted the dependencies step of deploy. In tsuru, an
application can have two kinds of dependencies:

* **Operating system dependencies**, represented by packages in the package manager
  of the underlying operating system (e.g.: ``yum`` and ``apt-get``);
* **Platform dependencies**, represented by packages in the package manager of the
  platform/language (in Ruby, ``bundler``).

All ``apt-get`` dependencies must be specified in a ``requirements.apt`` file,
located in the root of your application, and ruby dependencies must be located
in a file called ``Gemfile``, also in the root of the application.  Since we
will use MySQL with Rails, we need to install ``mysql`` package using ``gem``,
and this package depends on an ``apt-get`` package: ``libmysqlclient-dev``, so
here is how ``requirements.apt`` looks like:

::

    libmysqlclient-dev

And here is ``Gemfile``:

.. highlight:: ruby

::

    source 'https://rubygems.org'

    gem 'rails', '3.2.13'
    gem 'mysql'
    gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2.3'
    gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.1'
    gem 'therubyracer', platforms: 'ruby'
    gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
    gem 'jquery-rails'

You can see the complete output of installing these dependencies below:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ git push tsuru master

Running the application
=======================

As you can see, in the deploy output there is a step described as "Restarting
your app". In this step, tsuru will restart your app if it's running, or start
it if it's not. But how does tsuru start an application? That's very simple, it
uses a Procfile (a concept stolen from Foreman). In this Procfile, you describe
how your application should be started. Here is how the Procfile should look like:

::

    web: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT -e production

Now we commit the file and push the changes to tsuru Git server, running
another deploy:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ git add Procfile
    $ git commit -m "Procfile: added file"
    $ git push tsuru master
    #####################################
    #                OMIT               #
    #####################################
    remote:  ---> App will be restarted, please check its log for more details...
    remote:
    To git@192.168.50.4.nip.io:blog.git
       d67c3cd..f2a5d2d  master -> master

Now that the app is deployed, you can access it from your browser, getting the
IP or host listed in ``app-list`` and opening it. For example,
in the list below:

::

    $ tsuru app-list
    +-------------+-------------------------+---------------------+
    | Application | Units State Summary     | Address             |
    +-------------+-------------------------+---------------------+
    | blog        | 1 of 1 units in-service | blog.cloud.tsuru.io |
    +-------------+-------------------------+---------------------+


Deployment hooks
================

It would be boring to manually run ``rake db:migrate`` after every deployment.
So we can configure an automatic hook to always run before or after
the app restarts.

tsuru parses a file called ``tsuru.yaml`` and runs restart hooks. As the
extension suggests, this is a YAML file, that contains a list of commands that
should run before and after the restart. Here is our example of tsuru.yaml:

.. highlight:: yaml

::

    hooks:
      restart:
        before:
          - RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate

For more details, check the :ref:`hooks documentation <yaml_deployment_hooks>`.

tsuru will look for the file in the root of the project. Let's commit and
deploy it:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ git add tsuru.yaml
    $ git commit -m "tsuru.yaml: added file"
    $ git push tsuru master
    #####################################
    #                OMIT               #
    #####################################
    To git@192.168.50.4.nip.io:blog.git
       a780de9..1b675b8  master -> master

It is necessary to compile de assets before the app restart. To do it we can
use the ``rake assets:precompile`` command. Then let's add the command to
compile the assets in tsuru.yaml:

.. highlight:: yaml

::

    hooks:
      build:
        - RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ git add tsuru.yaml
    $ git commit -m "tsuru.yaml: added file"
    $ git push tsuru master
    #####################################
    #                OMIT               #
    #####################################
    To git@192.168.50.4.nip.io:blog.git
       a780de9..1b675b8  master -> master

It's done! Now we have a Rails project deployed on tsuru.

Now we can access your `blog app` in the URL returned in `app-info`.
